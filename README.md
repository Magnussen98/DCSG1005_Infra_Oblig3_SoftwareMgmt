# Portifolio 3; Maintaining Software

THE GIT REPO FOR PORTFOLIO 3 IS: https://gitlab.stud.iie.ntnu.no/andrefm/portifolio3

[[_TOC_]]

## Problem description / Goal of this project
In this assignment I was given the opportunity to learn the importance of maintaining a desired software on a computer. In todays society attackers are getting more sophisticated and they are constantly trying to [exploit software vulnerabilities.](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/exploit) Knowing your software will give you a huge advantage and multiple messaurments when a potential problem occour. I decided to choose Google Chrome as the client-software for this assignment.
   
## What is Google Chrome
Google Chrome is a free [web-browser developed by Google.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome) Google Chrome was first released in 2008, but only for Microsoft Windows. It was later developed further as a cross-platform. Today, Google Chrome is estimated to have [66% of the browser market shares worldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome). Google developed Chrome with the intension of having a secure web-browser. Chrome has multiple techonologies, such as [site isolation, phishing protection and sandboxing which makes the web-browser secure be default](https://safety.google/chrome/). 

## Security History
The [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) list 2486 matching records of vulnerabilities with Google Chrome as its keyword. NVD published, february 22 2021, a vulnerability with a base score of 9.6, which is a critical vulnerability for the software. This vulernability allowed a [remote attacker to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21155) Sandbox is an [isolated environment designed for experimentation and untested code changes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(software_development)). Google [patched this vulnerability in a stable channel update on februrary 16](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/02/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_16.html). NVD also published, february 9 2021, a [vulnerabitlity with a base score of 8.8.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21148). This vulnerability lets attackers to perform a heap overflow attack. This vulnerability enable attackers to [execute malicious code on a victim device remotely.](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/update-google-chrome-to-8804324150/38678/) This can again result in the attacker gaining full control over your computer. Google has patched this vulnerability aswell. 

Google Chrome releases a full update [every 6 weeks](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/3168106?hl=en). They do also patch security fixes and software updates [every 2-3 weeks](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/3168106?hl=en). If you potentially find a new bug, you can easily let the [developers know by filing a bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=iOS%20Issue).[Google Chrome automatically updates itsfelf](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) when a new version of the web-browser is available by default.

## Practice
I have created four simple scripts which enables me to install, configure, patch and uninstall Chrome. The [installation script](https://gitlab.stud.iie.ntnu.no/andrefm/portifolio3/-/blob/master/Install-Chrome.ps1) is using [Chocolatey,](https://chocolatey.org/) which is the package manager for windows, to install Google Chrome. I do also verify that full installation of Chrome has completed by doing a quick search in registry. The name of the software and the version installed are then displayed for the user. This will allow the user to verify that the correct version is installed. 

The [configuration script](https://gitlab.stud.iie.ntnu.no/andrefm/portifolio3/-/blob/master/Enable-configurationPossibility.ps1) will allow the user to make desired configurations with [Group Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_Policy). I did use some time to figure out how to configure Chrome through PowerShell. After some research it became clear that Group Policy would be the best option. The first part of the script is downloading a [Zip file with Google Chrome templates,](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/187202?hl=en#zippy=%2Cwindows) which makes Policy setup a lot easier. For the simplisity of this assignment, I decided to only enable the possibility to configure Chrome through GPO. GPO configuration will then be done by GUI. The last part of the script is making a central store folder .admx and .adml files. This will allow the user to configure Chrome through the Local Group Policy Editor.

The [unistall script](https://gitlab.stud.iie.ntnu.no/andrefm/portifolio3/-/blob/master/Uninstall-Chrome.ps1) is using Chocolatey to unistall Chrome. Chocolatey tracks packages by looking for changes made in registry of the underlying software native installer when installing packages. This will allow Chocolatey to know which packages to uninstall. However, after som research on how to completely uninstall Chrome, I found out that the hidden local [appdata folder store custom user settings and other information needed by applications](https://support.code42.com/CrashPlan/6/Backup/Back_up_the_AppData_folder_in_Windows). Chocolatey did not erase this folder when unistalling Chrome. As a result of this, the last part of my script is dedicated to erase this folder and the central store folder, which holds the GPO templates.

The [patch script](https://gitlab.stud.iie.ntnu.no/andrefm/portifolio3/-/blob/master/Patch-Chrome.ps1) is an extremely simple script which updates Chrome with Chocolatey.

## Conclusion and Reflection
I am overall hayppy with how this project turned out. The work was divided into three parts; researching, coding and reflecting. The research did take up the most time, but I also used some time to figure out how to enable configurations on Chrome. I did find it interesting to improve my software maintainaning skills and I do feel comfortable maintaning this software in production. The reason for this is because [Google has a good track record with security updates and patches](https://www.howtogeek.com/665251/why-you-should-never-disable-automatic-updates-in-chrome/). However, Chrome has 66% browser market shares today, and is therefore the most attractive web-browser on the market for attackers to exploit. This will push myself and every Chrome administrator to follow up on the latest knews, and constantly developing new teqchniques to keep the software secure.
